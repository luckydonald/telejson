JSON Reference:

This is represents the dependency structure, NOT the json nesting!
Short example to understand:

- foo:
    "nope"
    "bar"
        - baz
- hurr

If there is an key foo with value "bar", there will be another key bar.
{"foo":"bar", "baz":2, "hurr":3}
{"foo":"nope", "hurr":3}

If something is not always present, it is marked with an "*" and a condition is given after a "|":
    - foo
    * bar: [int] some random value | only sundays.
Lets begin:
