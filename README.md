## Telegram messenger CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luckydonald/tg-for-pytg2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/luckydonald/tg-for-pytg2)

Modified version of Telegram-CLI, which sends you the events as json. 
This is the beta! No documentation yet!
Also i am thinking about renaming this to "telejson" so the URL might change too
